# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

### The overview of this analysis was to find a category of prodcuts on Amazon and extract the data and then using that data to see if there's any bias on the reviews for the reviews that are paid vs the unpaid reviews. 

## Results

### There are a couple questions for the unpaid and paid program reviews. 
1. How many of these are verified purchases 
2. How many people found their review to be helpful
3. Total votes that that the individual reviews have

## Summary

### On this dataset we can see that there is no bias. We know that there's no bias on this because if we check the results we can see that only 18% of the 5 star reviews are paid while 51% of the 5 star reivews are unpaid. Another analysis that we can use to confirm this would be seeing how many of the reviews are from verified purchases.
